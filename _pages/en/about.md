At the Sustainable Development Summit held between 25 and 27 September 2015 in New York, Member States of the United Nations adopted the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. The Agenda represents a general call for action and partnerships in order to address the global challenges, end poverty, protect the planet and provide everyone with the opportunity to enjoy peace and prosperity. The Agenda defines five areas of critical importance for sustainable development of humanity and the planet (People, Planet, Prosperity, Peace, Partnership) and it is implemented through the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets.

The 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda covers issues of poverty and inequality, food security, quality of life and well-being for all, health, education, sustainable consumption and production, employment, growth, infrastructure, sustainable natural resources management, climate change, gender equality, inclusive, resilient and sustainable cities and settlements, as well as access to justice, and effective and accountable institutions.

The achievement of these goals is reported through sustainable development indicators, which represent the tools for measuring and monitoring changes in the economy, society and environment. The United Nations Statistical Commission created the Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDG), composed of Member States and including regional and international agencies as observers. IAEG-SDG developed the global indicator framework at the 48th session of the United States Statistical Commission held in March 2017. To facilitate the implementation of the global indicator framework, all indicators are classified by the IAEG-SDG into three tiers on the basis of their level of methodological development and the availability of data at the global level.
 
The development of reference indicator framework for monitoring the sustainable development goals in the context of the European Union is managed by Eurostat. The EU SDG indicator set was approved by the European Statistical System in May 2017. The set contains 100 indicators, structured along the 17 sustainable development goals and is balanced among the social, economic, environmental and institutional dimensions of sustainability. Each goal is presented through five to six indicators that reflect its overall goal.
 
This website serves to disseminate SDG indicators for Republika Srpska. With the support of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), the page is maintained by the Republika Srpska Institute of Statistics.
